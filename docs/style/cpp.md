# C++ Coding Style

## Status: Out of Scope

C++ code is currently **out of scope** for this project.

If C++ support is needed:
1. Refer to [c.md](c.md) for basic rules (naming, formatting)
2. Propose additional rules via RFC if necessary

## Future Scope

When C++ support is added, these topics will be covered:
- Smart pointer guidelines (unique_ptr, shared_ptr)
- RAII patterns
- Modern C++ features (C++17/20) usage scope
- Exception handling policy
