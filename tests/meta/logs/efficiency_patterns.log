Project: /Users/wonseok/project-iamwonseok/agent-context/.worktrees/feat-meta-validation

Note: This is STATIC ANALYSIS ONLY
Runtime efficiency requires actual execution logs.

Checking for (from RFC-010):
  - Repeated grep calls (use batch find)
  - Sequential operations (consider parallel)
  - Excessive test calls (batch at end)
  - Language policy automation
  - Batch operation documentation
